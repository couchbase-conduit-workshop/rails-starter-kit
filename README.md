> ### Conduit Starter Kit for Ruby on Rails

## What is Conduit?

See how the *exact* same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is built using any of our supported frontends and backends. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction). ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜Ž

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**Conduit** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real-world, beautifully designed full-stack app called [**Conduit**](https://conduit.realworld.how).

This starter kit has everything you need to get started with Conduit using Ruby on Rails and Couchbase. It includes:

- A preconfigured Couchbase connection, all you need to do is provide your credentials.
- The beginning of an RSpec test suite to ensure your application is working as expected.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Conduit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

### Getting started

Follow these steps to get the Conduit Ruby on Rails starter kit up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Ruby 3.3.x
* Bundler
* Rails 7.0.x
* Git

You will also need an account on Couchbase Capella to create a cluster and obtain the connection details.

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/couchbase-conduit-workshop/rails-starter-kit.git
cd rails-starter-kit
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
bundle install
```

**Configure Couchbase Credentials**

Copy the `.env.sample` file in the root directory of the project and rename it to `.env`. Update the `.env` file with your Couchbase credentials as follows:

```bash
COUCHBASE_USER=your_COUCHBASE_USER
COUCHBASE_PASSWORD=your_couchbase_password
COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_couchbase_connection_string_url
COUCHBASE_BUCKET=your_couchbase_bucket
```

You can obtain those credentials by first creating an account on Couchbase Capella at [https://cloud.couchbase.com/](https://cloud.couchbase.com/) and then creating a database called `Conduit_Rails_App`. Inside the database, create a bucket. The name of the bucket is what you should use for the `COUCHBASE_BUCKET` environment variable.

Once you have done so, you can navigate to the `Connect` tab in the database and copy the connection string URL. This is what you should use for the `COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. You will also need to create a user with the appropriate permissions and use the username and password for the `COUCHBASE_USER` and `COUCHBASE_PASSWORD` environment variables.

**Running the Test Suite**

This application includes the beginnings of a test suite using RSpec. To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

This will run all the tests and output the results in the terminal. You can run any specific test file by passing the file path as an argument to the `rspec` command, as follows:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/config/couchbase_spec.rb
```

**Starting the Application**

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

This will start the Rails server, and you can access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
