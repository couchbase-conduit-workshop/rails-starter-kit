> ### Conduit Starter Kit for Ruby on Rails

## What is Conduit?

See how the *exact* same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is built using any of our supported frontends and backends. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction). ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜Ž

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**Conduit** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real-world, beautifully designed full-stack app called [**Conduit**](https://conduit.realworld.how).

This starter kit has everything you need to get started with Conduit using Ruby on Rails and Couchbase. It includes:

- **A Rails API server** with CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.
- **Couchbase pre-configured** for storing data.
- **Full frontend application** with pages for Home, Sign In, Sign Up, Settings, Profile, Editor, Article, and more.
- **A complete test suite** with RSpec for models, controllers, and request specs.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Ruby on Rails community styleguides & best practices.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Conduit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

### Architecture Overview

The general architecture of this implementation is as follows:

1. Rails MVC Framework:

* The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture provided by Ruby on Rails. This structure helps in organizing the codebase in a maintainable and scalable way.
* Models represent the application's data and business logic.
* Views are used to present data to the user.
* Controllers handle incoming requests, interact with models, and render the appropriate views or JSON responses.

2. Couchbase as the Database:

* The application uses Couchbase, a NoSQL database, for storing data. Couchbase is known for its flexibility, scalability, and high performance.
* The Couchbase Ruby ORM is used to interact with the database, providing an object-oriented interface for performing CRUD operations on data.
* The application uses Couchbase to store user profiles, articles, comments, tags, and other data.

3. JWT Authentication:

* User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This provides a stateless and secure method for authenticating users.
* Tokens are issued during login and are used to authenticate subsequent requests.

4. RESTful API:

* The application exposes a RESTful API that adheres to the RealWorld specification. This includes endpoints for managing users, profiles, articles, comments, and tags.
* The API supports common operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), and also includes additional functionality like favoriting articles and following users.

5. Routing:

* Rails routing is used to map incoming requests to the appropriate controller actions. The routes are defined in the config/routes.rb file.
* Namespaced routes are used for the API endpoints, ensuring clear separation between different parts of the application.

6. Controllers and Actions:

* User Controller: Handles user registration, login, profile management, and authentication.
* Article Controller: Manages CRUD operations for articles, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving articles.
* Comment Controller: Manages comments on articles, including adding and deleting comments.
* Tag Controller: Handles retrieving tags associated with articles.
* Profile Controller: Manages user profiles, including following and unfollowing users.

7. Error Handling:

* The application includes comprehensive error handling to ensure that appropriate error messages are returned for different scenarios, such as invalid data, unauthorized actions, and resource not found.

8. Testing:

* The application is tested using RSpec, a popular testing framework for Ruby. Tests cover models, controllers, and request specs to ensure the application's functionality and reliability.
* Mocks and stubs are used to simulate interactions with Couchbase during tests, allowing for isolated and faster test execution.

9. Documentation and Best Practices:

* The codebase adheres to Ruby on Rails community style guides and best practices, ensuring readability, maintainability, and consistency.
* Comments and documentation are included throughout the codebase to explain key concepts and implementation details.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to get the Conduit Ruby on Rails starter kit up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Ruby 3.3.x
* Bundler
* Rails 7.0.x
* Git

You will also need an account on Couchbase Capella to create a cluster and obtain the connection details.

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/couchbase-conduit-workshop/rails-starter-kit.git
cd rails-starter-kit
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
bundle install
```

**Configure Couchbase Credentials**

Copy the `.env.sample` file in the root directory of the project and rename it to `.env`. Update the `.env` file with your Couchbase credentials as follows:

```bash
COUCHBASE_USER=your_COUCHBASE_USER
COUCHBASE_PASSWORD=your_couchbase_password
COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_couchbase_connection_string_url
COUCHBASE_BUCKET=your_couchbase_bucket
```

You can obtain those credentials by first creating an account on Couchbase Capella at [https://cloud.couchbase.com/](https://cloud.couchbase.com/) and then creating a database called `Conduit_Rails_App`. Inside the database, create a bucket. The name of the bucket is what you should use for the `COUCHBASE_BUCKET` environment variable.

Once you have done so, you can navigate to the `Connect` tab in the database and copy the connection string URL. This is what you should use for the `COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. You will also need to create a user with the appropriate permissions and use the username and password for the `COUCHBASE_USER` and `COUCHBASE_PASSWORD` environment variables.

**Running the Test Suite**

This application includes a comprehensive test suite that covers models, controllers, and request specs. To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

This will run all the tests and output the results in the terminal. You can run any specific test file by passing the file path as an argument to the `rspec` command, as follows:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
```

**Starting the Application**

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

This will start the Rails server, and you can access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoints that adhere to the RealWorld specification. Here are a few examples:

* `GET /api/articles`: Get a list of articles.
* `POST /api/articles`: Create a new article.
* `GET /api/articles/:slug`: Get a specific article by slug.
* `PUT /api/articles/:slug`: Update an article by slug.
* `DELETE /api/articles/:slug`: Delete an article by slug.
* `POST /api/articles/:slug/comments`: Add a comment to an article.
* `DELETE /api/articles/:slug/comments/:id`: Delete a comment by id.
* `POST /api/articles/:slug/favorite`: Favorite an article.
* `DELETE /api/articles/:slug/favorite`: Unfavorite an article.
* `GET /api/tags`: Get a list of tags.

For a complete list of API endpoints and examples, refer to the [API Spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction).
